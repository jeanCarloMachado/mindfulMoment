# Mindful moment


A dead-simple macos app for registering your mindful moments.

The key of mindfulness is the realization that we've been lost in thought. For some instants in those moments we truly achieve mindfulness.
The purpose of this app is to register any of those mindful moments and influence our momentum to keep increasing.
